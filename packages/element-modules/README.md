# Element Lerna Module Tests

This module uses create-react-app to test that modules in this mono repo work with node and jsdom.

Because of Rollup Bundling for UMD, many modules use peerDependencies.

These must be installed in order to use the peer library.

This repo shows a minimal example of this.
